echo "  - Real-time broadcasting: âœ… Custom Publisher/Subscriber pattern"
echo "  - Thread-safe subscriber management: âœ… ConcurrentLinkedQueue"
echo "  - Integration with mutations: âœ… Property creation/updates trigger broadcasts"

echo "ðŸ“‹ Key Features Implemented:"
echo "  1. Custom Publisher implementation for GraphQL subscriptions"
echo "  2. Thread-safe subscriber management with proper cleanup"
echo "  3. Real-time property broadcasting to all subscribers"
echo "  4. Integration with mutation data fetchers"
echo "  5. Error handling and graceful subscriber management"

echo "ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:"
echo "  - Uses Reactive Streams Publisher/Subscriber interfaces"
echo "  - Custom PropertyPublisher manages multiple subscribers"
echo "  - PropertySubscription handles individual subscriber lifecycle"
echo "  - Broadcasting happens immediately when properties are created/updated"

echo "  3. PropertySubscriptionDataFetcher.broadcastProperty() called"
echo "  4. All active subscribers receive the property immediately"
